	<h1>What did I learn?</h1>
	<p><del>Absolutely nothing!</del> I decided that I wanted to learn how to create a nice little dropdown on my blog. I figure that it could probably come in handy in my eventual users' selection future, and wouldn't you know it the tag itself is called <code>&lt;select&gt;</code>. Here, I'll even give you an example in case you're not sure what I'm talking about:	
	</p>
	Is this the sickest blog out there?
	<select>
		<option disabled selected value></option>
		<option>Yes</option>
		<option>Yes</option>
		<option>Yes</option>
		<option>Yes</option>
		<option>Yes</option>
		<option>Yes</option>
		<option>Yes</option>
		<option>Yes</option>
	</select>
	<p>Well, we both know that you chose the correct option ;). During this exercise in learning new things, I also was curious as to how I would get my first option in the list to be blank (as not to spoil the rest of the options). Luckily, I found this helpful <a href = "https://www.stackoverflow.com/questions/8605516/default-select-option-as-blank">StackOverflow</a> thread where someone was curious about the same thing. HTML being used as a vessel to learn more about HTML, isn't that something? I also wanted to add some sort of home button to return back to the index from this and future blog posts, so with the help of this  <a href = "w3docs.com/snippets/html/how-to-create-an-html-button-that-acts-like-a-link.html">article</a> I was able to get exactly what I wanted using this code:</p>
<code>&lt;form action = "index.html"&gt;<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&lt;button type = "submit"&gt;Home&lt;/button&gt;<br>
&lt;/form&gt;
</code>
